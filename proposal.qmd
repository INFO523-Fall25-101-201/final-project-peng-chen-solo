The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a major program that assesses the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States by combining interviews with physical examinations. Each year about 5,000 participants are examined, providing a representative snapshot of the U.S. population’s health. In this project, we will leverage NHANES data from 2015–2016 and 2017–March 2020 (pre-pandemic) cycles to model baseline (pre-COVID) human health and nutrition status.

I will use a Python script `get_xpt_files_from_NHANES.py` to scrape NHANES website since the data files are in .xpt (SAS) format and they are quite numbered.

The data files will be curated, cleaned and combined into a single Pandas DataFrame object, which will be used to train the GAN.

## Questions

Q1: Do the synthetic patient data follow the same distribution as the training dataset?
Q2: Do the synthetic patient data improve the ordinal regression classifier as compared to the original dataset?

## Analysis plan

- Build a Data Pipeline
- Train a GAN Model
- Evaluate Synthetic Data distribution
- Compare the ordinal regression model between original and synthetic data
